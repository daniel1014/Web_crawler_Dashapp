A web application in Dash framework to deploy in Azure Web Apps Service.
To avoid being blocked as against the terms of service of both Azure/Google, it utilized an official Google programmable search engine V1 with a unique API key and search engine ID for the purpose of customized web scrapping (Free-tier with limit of 10,000 queries per day)

It's important to note that the Azure web app operates on the Free F1 plan with the lowest scale of CPU and memory. Consequently, there is a loading time of approximately 1-3 minutes during the initial launch. However, once activated, the application operates smoothly.
